                <li>What are the benefits of using CSS? </li>
            </strong>
            <p>Ans:- The following are the benefits of CSS :-</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>CSS saves time:-</dt>
                <dd>You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</dd>
                <dt>Easy maintenance:-</dt>
                <dd>To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</dd>
                <dt>Global web standards:-</dt>
                <dd>Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers</dd>
                <dt>Platform Independence:-</dt>
                <dd>The Script offer consistent platform independence and can support latest browsers as well.</dd>

                </strong>
                <p>Ans:- The following are the Disadvantages of CSS :-</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Confusion due to many CSS levels:-</dt>
                    <dd>Beginners are more vulnerable to this issue. They might get confused while opting to learn CSS as there are many levels of CSS such as CSS2, CSS3, etc.</dd>
                    <dt>Cross-Browser Issues:-</dt>
                    <dd>Different browsers work differently. So, you have to check that changes implemented in the website via CSS codes are reflected properly among all browsers.</dd>
                    <dt>Security Issues:-</dt>
                    <dd>Security is important in today’s world driven by technology and data. One of the major disadvantages of CSS is that it has limited security.</dd>
                    <dt>Extra Work for Developers:-</dt>
                    <dd>Design services are required to consider and test all CSS codes across different browsers for compatibility. Due to developers testing compatibility for different browsers, their workload increases.</dd>

                    <li>What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there’s a wider range of browser support. Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility.</p>
                <strong>
                    <li>Name a few CSS style components</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties:- These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size , width , background-color .</li>
                    <li>Values:- Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>
                    <li>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element.<br>
                        The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent.
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>How can the background color of an element be changed? </li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:- To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.</p>
              <h3>Example:-</h3>

                <li>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled? </li>
            </strong>
            <p>Ans:- To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.</p>
            <h3>Example:-</h3>
            <code>
                &lt;html&gt;<br>

               /*  background-repeat: repeat;*/<br>
               }<br>
               &lt;/style&gt;<br>
               &lt;/head&gt;<br>
               &lt;body&gt;<br>
               &lt;p&gt;HTML Articles&lt;/p&gt;<br>

                <li>What is the use of the background-position property?  </li>
            </strong>
            <p>Ans:- The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.</p>
            <h3>Example:-</h3>
            <code>
                    &lt;html&gt;<br>

                </strong>
                <p>Ans:- There are two reasons behind this: </p>
                    <ol>
                     <li>It enhances the legibility of style sheets.</li>

                        <li>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</li>
                    </strong>
                    <p>Ans:- There are three ways to integrates css into a webpage</p>
            <ol>
             <li><b>Inline:</b>HTML elements may have css appied to them via the STYLE attribute</li>
             <li><b>Embedded:</b>By placing the code in a STYLE element within the HEAD element</li>
             <li><b>Linked/Impored:</b>Place the css in an external file and lik it via a link element</li>
          </ol>
          <strong>
            <li>What is embedded style sheets? </li>
        </strong>
        <p>Ans:-Place your CSS rules into an HTML document using the &lt;style&gt; element that is called embedded CSS.
             This tag is placed inside &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt; tags. Rules defined using this syntax will be applied
              to all the elements available in the document.</p>

              <strong>
                <li>What are the external style sheets? </li>
            </strong>
            <p>Ans:-An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. 
                Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet.
                 The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</p>
                 <h3>Example</h3>
                 <h4>html:-</h4>
                 <code>
                    &lt;html&gt;<br>

                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css"&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/head&gt;<br>
                    &lt;body&gt;<br>
                    &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/html&gt;<br>

                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-</p>
                <h3>Advantages of extrenal styel sheet:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Separation of content and presentation:</b> An external style sheet allows you to separate the content of your website (HTML) from the presentation (CSS).
                         This makes it easier to maintain and update your website, as you only need to change the style sheet rather than making changes to the HTML of each individual page.</li>
                    <li><b>Reusable styles:</b>An external style sheet can be reused across multiple pages and websites,
                            saving time and making it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel.</li>
                    <li><b>Improved performance:</b>An external style sheet is only loaded once, even if it is used on multiple pages. This can improve the performance of your website,
                         as the browser does not need to download the same styles repeatedly.</li>
               </ul>
               <h3>Disadvantages of extrenal styel sheet:</h3>
               <ul>
                <li><b>Additional HTTP request:</b>An external style sheet requires an additional HTTP request to load, 
                    which can slightly increase the time it takes for the page to render.</li>
                <li><b>Limited control:</b>With an external style sheet, you have less control over the specific elements on a page,
                     as the styles are applied globally to all elements that use the same class or ID.</li>  
                <li><b>Harder to override:</b>It can be harder to override the styles in an external style sheet, as they are applied globally. To override a style, you need to use more specific selectors or use the !important declaration, 
                    which can make your style sheet more complex and difficult to maintain.</li>
                    </ul>
